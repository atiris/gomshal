# gomshal

 Extracts Shared locations from Google Maps to json object *(replacement for official missing api for shared location)* as node.js library. As this is not an official api, it requires to log in to a google account with a **username and password**. üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ üîé üåç

## Install

üîΩ Download using npm: `npm install gomshal --save`

### Npm ignore scripts flag

‚ùóÔ∏è Enabling npm scripts is necessary to install `playwright`. Using npm scripts, browsers are installed which can then be controlled automatically.

If you have set `npm config get ignore-scripts` to true, you will not be able to use npm run commands even you specify `--ignore-scripts=false`. This is because npm-run-all is used when running commands and this tool not forward npm ignore-scripts flag. You can disable ignore scripts with `npm config set ignore-scripts false`. If you want to only install after repository clone, you can call ignore script only temporary for that install with `npm install --ignore-scripts=false`.

## Usage

üëÖ Typescript

```typescript
import { Gomshal, GomshalConfiguration, GomshalState, GomshalInputs } from 'gomshal';

async main() {
  // create new instance
  const gomshal: Gomshal = new Gomshal();

  // zlucit configuration a initialize
  // login a password sa zmaze po pouziti

  // you can change any configuration parameter if you need
  const customConfiguration: GomshalConfiguration = {headless: false, showDevTools: true};
  // and update configuration (you can skip this to use defaults)
  const newConfiguration: GomshalConfiguration = gomshal.configuration(customConfiguration);
  // to get actual configuration you can call configuration withous arguments
  const actualConfiguration: GomshalConfiguration = gomshal.configuration();
  // initialize browser with google maps
  let state: GomshalState = await gomshal.initialize();
  // if there is any error or login required then state is not GomshalState.Ok
  if (state === GomshalState.LoginRequired ) {
    // get login and password from user and initialize again
    const inputs: GomshalInputs = {login: 'google@gmail.com', password: 'secret'};
    state = await gomshal.initialize(inputs);
  }
  // if 2FA is required
  if (state === GomshalState.TwoFactorAuthenticationRequired ) {
    // ask the user for confirmation on the phone and try again
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 60000));
    state = await gomshal.initialize();
  }
  // get last location data
  locationData = await gomshal.getSharedLocations();
  gomshal.onSharedLocation((locationData) => {
    ...
  })
  // observables
  gomshal.newSharedLocations$...

  // or subscribe for changes with observables
}
main();
```

## Demo

üëÄ There is an [Electron](<https://www.electronjs.org/>) demo inside this monorepo. You can run it using this steps:

- clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/atiris/gomshal.git`,
- open it `cd gomshal` and run `npm install`
- start `npm run demo`

## Development

üîΩ Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/atiris/gomshal.git`, `cd gomshal` and run `npm install`.

### How does this library work

‚ùì Since 2020 Google require javascript to log in. So we need full browser support for using Google Maps. For that reason I tried to use a [puppeteer](<https://pptr.dev/>). However, this library has trouble enabling login because Google can effectively identify browser control and declare such a browser unsuitable for login. I use [playwright](<https://playwright.dev/>) instead. This project has a similar focus, and so far allows for automated login.

Dependency instalation: `npm i playwright --save`

### Windows

It may be necessary to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in powershell console (as Administrator).

## Publishing

### Npm

Build: `tsc` and then run for:
Initial library publishing `npm publish`
Bugfix or patch: `npm version patch`
New features: `npm version minor`
Breaking changes: `npm version major`

## Notes

Based on [node-google-shared-locations](<https://github.com/Vaelek/node-google-shared-locations>) repository. Which I could no longer simply modify without significant modifications in the library architecture.
